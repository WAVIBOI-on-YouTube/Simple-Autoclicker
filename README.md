Hello and thank you for using Simple Autoclicker. There is no GUI interface rather a text interface.
To use Autoclicker, please press "T" to activate. 
If you are worried that this is a virus, you can go ahead and check out "main.py" in this folder. 
It may say that Windows Defender protected your PC because it's a virus so, just click "Run Anyway".
If the file has disappeared, that's Windows Defender or your antivirus deleting the autoclicker.
If anything bad happens or you used a modified version of the Autoclicker, we are not responsible.

Version: 0.9

NEW VERSION 0.9a COMING SOON!

Fixes that will be in version 0.9a: Antivirus doesn't delete the file. The app will not be seen as a virus. 

Future updates: New GUI interface.
